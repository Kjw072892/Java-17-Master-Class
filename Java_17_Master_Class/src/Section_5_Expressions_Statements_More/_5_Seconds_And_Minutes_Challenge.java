        Seconds and Minutes Challenge:

            In this challenge, we're going to create a method, that takes time, represented in seconds, as the
            parameter.

            We'll then want to transform the seconds into hours.

            Next, you'll display the time in hours with the remaining minutes and seconds in a String.
