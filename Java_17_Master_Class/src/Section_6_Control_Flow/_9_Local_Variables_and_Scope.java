    /*
        A local variable is called local because it is available for use by the code vlock in which it was declared.

        It is also available to code blocks that are contained by a declaring block

        Local variables are always in scope in the block they are declared.

        They are also in scope for any nested blocks or blocks contained within the outer block.

        Local variables are always out of scope for outer blocks or the containing blocks they are declared in.

        public static void aMethod(boolean aBoolean) {

            if (aBoolean) {

                int myCounter = 10; // myCounter declared in the if statement block

                }

            System.out.println(myCounter); // myCounter is out of scope here

        }
    }
        It is considered best practice to declare and initialize variables in the same place, if possible, and to
        declare variables in the narrowest scope possible.
