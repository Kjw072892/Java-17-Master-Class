This section has been intentionally left blank due to the course going over the functions of intellij IDEA.

However, this section went over some basic concepts such as the "and" operator and the "or" operator,
Ternary operator, operator precedence, and operator challenge.

Ternary operator:

operand1 ? operand2 : operand3

where operand1 is a boolean while operand2  and operand3 are x-data type where x encompasses any data type.
